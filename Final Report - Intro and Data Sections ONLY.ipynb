    "Consider one of these scenarios:\n",
    "* You are the owner of a travel blog, or\n",
    "* You work for a travel company writing articles, or\n",
    "* You work for a company doing research into travel and/or the New York City night life, or\n",
    "* (A different alternative:) You're a prospective bar or night club owner looking to profit off being in an active nightlife area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you want to write an article or report on what life was like before COVID-19, or you're prepping some content for all the people planning to travel once it's over. In any case, our goal is to write an \"N Places...\" article, because who doesn't love a good 12 Places to Take a Really Cool Selfie in NYC article?\n",
    "\n",
    "What type of list would be best? Well, why not one that facilitates an adventurous social gathering that invovles a core group and the potential to meet lots of people? The answer is clear: Bar Crawl Spots in NYC! Who doesn't love a good bar crawl?\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we want to give some travelers good advice when visiting New York City, but we're not locals, or very well-versed in the night-life. In fact, this writer is from and residing in California. So we want to use data to help us.\n",

    "The answer to this will help us write a great article or report with actual maps of the areas and actual places to go to. Our number of clusters *k* will be the \"N\" bar crawl areas, but the actual value of k will depend on the *quality* of the clusters: do they contain actual bars, and are they close together?; as well as the *quantity*: are regions that could be considered one crawl split up into two, or three? Are several different crawls being lumped into one?\n",
